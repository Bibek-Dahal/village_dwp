## Drinking Water Project
    At past there were not separate tap for each house on my village and people have to share one tap among them. As there was no proper scheduling for water, villagers used to debet among themselves. So, to overcome this issue villagers come up with idea of meter system tap and each house owner was provided one water meter.
    Villagers have to pay monthly according to the water consumption and those information must be stored somewhere.
    Instead of keeping those records traditionally why not modernize it?
    So I have come up with idea of modernization.
